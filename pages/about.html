        <p>Grinding Gears is creating a unique coffee experience in Vancouver. By combining two icons of Vancouver, bikes and coffee, we will bring the quality of the city’s best cafes to the parks and streets.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Serving Groundswell coffee, freshly brewed using a pour-over method, not only will Grinding Gears will be a convenient option for excellent coffee but we are creating opportunities for self directed and sustainable self employment.</p>

        <br>

        <p>It’s no secret that Vancouver is an expensive city and it can be very difficult to get a foot-hold here. The 3 founding members of Grinding Gears have a vision of expanding to multiple bikes, more worker-members and ultimately a community of shared success.</p>

        <br>

        <p>As a cooperative, we are a democratically controlled organization whose main goal is the financial independence and quality of life of our members and through the coffee bike, Grinding Gears has developed a low-overhead business model that means livable wages and a flexible schedule.</p>

        <br>

        <p>So if you like coffee and you want to know when we’ll be hitting the streets, or if you are interested in joining the co-op as a worker member, please get in touch <strong><a href="contact.html" alt="Contact page link">here</a></strong>.</p>
